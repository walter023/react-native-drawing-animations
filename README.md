# React Native Architecture
React Native has recently undergone a major architectural change, known as "Fabric". This new architecture is designed to improve performance, reduce the size of the runtime, and make it easier to add new features and APIs to React Native.

"react-native-drawing-animations" showcases animations that are built using the new Fabric architecture, which provides significant performance improvements and a more streamlined development experience. These animations take advantage of the new Animated API in Fabric, which enables smooth and performant animations even on low-end devices.

# Usage
"react-native-drawing-animations" is not a library, but rather a collection of examples showcasing how to implement drawing animations using Reanimated, React, and Hooks. To view the examples, simply download or clone the repository from GitHub and run the application on your local machine. The animations can be viewed and interacted with on both iOS and Android devices.
